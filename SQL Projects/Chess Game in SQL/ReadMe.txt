This Project is for creating a simple Chess Game using SQL

The recent International Chess Olympiad held at Chennai triggered a thought in me to build the game using SQL. It was little challenging and interesting to spend couple of days to complete this project. I have uploaded source code of this project to GITHUB for others to look into and provide feedback.

Implemented Functionalities:
•	Players can pay the Chess Game by calling Stored Procedure with simple parameters
•	All next possible moves of the selected piece will be generated and shown
•	Previous played piece movements can be reversed one by one till start of the play
•	All the piece movement history is maintained
•	Chess board layout will be displayed in SQL output
•	Chess board layout will be shown in both White pieces player and Black piece Player perspective

Technical Implementation:
•	Normalized Table design
•	Recursive SQL Query & PIVOT are used
•	Modularized Stored Procedures approach
•	Error handling
•	Totally 10 Objects (4 Tables & 6 Stored Procedures)
•	Approximate 600 Lines of Code written
•	Added detailed Comments for easy to understand
